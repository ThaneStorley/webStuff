<h2>This is a website by me, for me (for now).</h2>

<p>This website serves as a platform for which I can host and run my own applications, 
as well as a page for you to find out a bit more about me. This page is currently under 
some HEAVY construction, so please forgive all the spelling errors, lack of information, 
unfinished projects, unregulated time travel, and most importantly the bland look. Come 
back soon :)</p>
